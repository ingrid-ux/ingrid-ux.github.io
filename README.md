### 🍦[My LIVE Website](https://ingrid-ux.github.io/)


Here is my Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment. This is my FIRST time building a website with HTML and CSS and used+learned Atom to code this project. I've never coded a website before so this was very cool! This project took about 3 days to complete. I took inspiration from the official SomiSomi webpage and wanted to provide a fun and modern website to the small buisness. All images and videos were edited and some drawn by me using Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop. I scouted for the videos through personal youtube channels from workers and cropped them for the website to look less static.
